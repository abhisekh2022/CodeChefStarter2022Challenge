PROBLEM NAME - EVEN SUBSET XOR
PROBLEM CODE - EVENXOR
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION - 

A number X is called bad if its binary representation contains odd number of 1 bits. For example, X=13=(1101)2 is bad while X=3=(11)2 is not bad.

Chef calls an array A of length N special if the following conditions hold:

For each 1≤i≤N, 0≤Ai<220
All the elements of A are distinct
There does not exist any non-empty subset of A such that the bitwise XOR of the subset is bad.
For example,

A=[2,3,4] is not special because the XOR of the subset [2,3] is 2⊕3=1, which is bad. (⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation)
A=[3,3] is not special because its elements are not distinct.
A=[3,5] is special because it satisfies all the conditions.
Chef challenges you to construct any special array of length N. Can you complete Chef's challenge?

Input Format - 

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N — the length of the special array to be constructed.

Output Format -

For each test case, output a single line containing N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the special array of length N you constructed.

Note: It can be proved that a special array of length N always exists under the given constraints.

Constraints - 

1≤T≤100
1≤N≤1000
0≤Ai<220

Sample Input-
2
1
2
Sample Output -
6
3 5
Explanation-
Test Case 1: There is only one non-empty subset of the given array, namely [6]. The XOR of this subset is 6=(110)2, which is not bad.

Test Case 2: The given array has three non-empty subsets, namely [3],[5], and [3,5].

[3] has XOR 3=(11)2, which is not bad.
[5] has XOR 5=(101)2, which is not bad.
[3,5] has XOR 6=(110)2, which is not bad
